# Next.js Hero Component & Responsive Navbar

This project is a Next.js application that implements a hero component for the landing page and a responsive navbar. The project utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, along with Headless UI components, specifically the Dialog component. Additionally, it includes a GraphQL request to a mock endpoint at [GraphQL Zero](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api) to trigger the `createUser` mutation.

## Features

- **Hero Component**: A visually appealing hero component is implemented for the landing page, showcasing key information about the application or website.

- **Responsive Navbar**: The application includes a responsive navbar that adapts to different screen sizes, providing seamless navigation across devices.

- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to building modern web interfaces.

- **Headless UI Dialog Component**: The project utilizes the Dialog component from Headless UI for creating accessible and customizable modal dialogs.

- **GraphQL Mutation**: A GraphQL mutation `createUser` is implemented to interact with the mock endpoint provided by GraphQL Zero, allowing users to trigger the creation of a new user. React-toastify is implemented on front-end to display success or error messages for the mutation.
